## Project Objectives
For this project, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis, practicing your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Python.

For this project, we have provided **two options**. Students should choose **one** of the following options, then complete all of the **required** sections for the option they've chosen. Note, you are free to work on both notebooks, but only one is reqiured. We encourage you to do both if you have the time.


### Option 1: Use your new pandas skills
Using your new Pandas skills, complete a series of guided prompts exploring [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv). IMDB stands for "the Internet Movie Database," an online collection of film information and reviews.
 
In these exercises, students will be looking to answer such questions as: 

- What is the average rating per genre?
- How many different actors are in a movie?

The IMDB dataset provided is created from data scraped from the [Internet Movie Database website](https://www.imdb.com. The dataset describes top ranking movies, including: title, data, duration, content rating, headlining actors, and ranking.


### Option 2: Keep building Python Skills
Using python only (no Pandas), conduct some exploratory data analysis on Covid-19 data from [John Hopkins University: CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data). You will be looking to answer such questions as: 

  - What is the average case globally?
  - How many average cases are there by country or region?
  - Compare the case fatality rate (CFR) for different regions. 

The Covid data from John Hopkins is one of the most visible and comprehensive covid-19 datasets in the world. It was chosen for it's relevance and timeliness. 

This dataset has been analyzed in-depth by numerous sources. More information can be found at [John Hopkins Corona Virus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions for the Option you've chosen. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter-code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the other option or complete the **bonus** sections for an additional challenge!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

 - Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor. [or]
 - Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
